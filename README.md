Web Dev Project for CSE 482
<p> This repository has been created for the course project of Internet and Web Technology (CSE482) of North South University. Medico is a web application which allows you to find a doctor suitable for the user condition. At present,
there is a gaping hole in the market, where the users have a hard time in trying to find the correct
doctor and setting appointments. Medico aims to fix the problem of users having to waste time in
setting appointments, and also brings forward the information of doctors required for users to choose
an appropriate doctor. This helps in allowing users to gain access to all the information required for
choosing a doctor, and also allowing to set appointments with the doctor of their choice. Future scope
of the work includes the implementation of machine learning in order to predict the diseases of the
symptoms experiences by the user, along with additional developments of the web application itself. </p>


<h2>Features: </h2>
<ul>
	<li>Registration and Signing In: Patients can register and create an account through the sign up form, which is created upon admin approval, or can also use Google account to login. </li>
	<li>Doctor List & Search: List of all doctors can be found according to the specialization, and live search can be carried out according to the doctor name. </li>
	<li>Appointment: Registered users can create an appointment with the doctors they want to. The appointments are admin approved. Once the admin approves the appointments, the user's appointment is confirmed.</li>
	<li>Navigate and Contact: Maps have been integrated using API so the user can find navigation, with the help of the map. Contact details are also included with the map. </li>

</ul>

<h2>Technical Details:</h2>

<p>For the front end development of the web
application: 
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Java script was used. </p>
<p>For the back end
development, PHP and MySQL database has been used.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Future Scope:</h2>
<p>We embarked on the project with the intention of developing a web application which will aid in
solving the problem of setting appointments with the doctors. We have been able to create and host a
functional appointment system, facing road blocks along the way particularly with the implementation
of APIs. The future scope of the work involves developing the website itself, and integrating machine
learning in order to predict diseases for user input symptoms.</p>
